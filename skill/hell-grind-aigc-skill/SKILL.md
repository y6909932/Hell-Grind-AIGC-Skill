# Hell Grind AIGC Skill

Use this single parent Skill as a model-agnostic AIGC production system. Keep approved project facts, creative instructions, provider settings, generation attempts, and review decisions separate.

## Classify the request

Determine these dimensions before writing:

- Workflow: 生产管理 / 提示词创作 / 失败诊断.
- Medium: image / video / mixed project.
- Operation: create / polish / initialize / audit / diagnose.
- Richness: 精简版 / 标准版 / 导演版.
- Context: standalone prompt / existing project.
- Provider: unspecified / named without adaptation / explicit adaptation requested.
- Authority: text only / local files / media generation / upload or publication.

## Route to the minimum references

For any non-trivial prompt, first read `references/prompt-architecture.md`. Read `references/methodology-evidence.md` when explaining why the workflow uses assets, versions, iteration, or risk gates.

### 生产管理工作流

For project setup, tracking, continuity, review, or delivery, read:

- `references/production-workflow.md`
- `references/project-schemas.md`
- `references/project-qa-gates.md` for audit or delivery

### 提示词创作工作流：图片从零生成 / 图片润色扩写

Read:

- `references/image-prompt-crafting.md`
- `references/reference-asset-control.md` for asset sheets, identity/state versions, or reference inheritance
- `references/spatial-blocking.md` for multiple subjects, exact placement, screen direction, or unique props
- `references/prompt-preservation.md`
- `references/prompt-quality-rubric.md`

### 视频从零生成 / 视频润色扩写

Read:

- `references/video-prompt-contract.md`
- `references/camera-editing-language.md` for framing, lens effect, movement, focus, cuts, or camera failures
- `references/performance-direction.md` for acting, eyelines, breath, dialogue performance, or stillness
- `references/action-physics-vfx.md` for movement, impact, fights, throws, destruction, creatures, or effects
- `references/spatial-blocking.md` for exact placement, direction, axis, and unique objects
- `references/prompt-preservation.md`
- `references/prompt-quality-rubric.md`

### 失败诊断

Start with the relevant quality gate and production record. Identify whether the defect belongs to the asset, scene/shot contract, prompt, provider adapter, generation attempt, or edit. Read the image or video guide for the affected layer. Do not default to adding more negative words.

Read `references/prompt-examples.md` only when an example materially helps. For work inside an existing project, first load its approved asset, scene, shot, prompt version, generation, selection, and continuity records.

## Work in this order

1. Extract intent, hard constraints, reference scope, output use, and authority.
2. Preserve explicit counts, duration, exact text/dialogue, identity, state, rights, and prohibited content.
3. Ask only when a missing fact would materially change the result; otherwise state a conservative assumption.
4. Build a model-independent artifact, then place provider-specific settings in a separate platform adapter.
5. Check IDs, references, timing, spatial logic, continuity, contradictions, and current quality gates.
6. Return the artifact with the fixed output required by its reference.

## Choose richness deliberately

- **精简版**: low-complexity exploration; keep only result-determining facts.
- **标准版**: default production form; cover the complete image or shot contract without repeating approved facts.
- **导演版**: complex action, dialogue, multi-character, multi-shot, or strict-continuity work; expose timing, performance, camera endpoints, audio, continuity, and risk locks.

Richness changes detail, never the user's intent or hard constraints.

## Initialize or audit a project

Run the bundled scripts when local file creation is requested:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_project.py --name "Project name" --output /absolute/project/path
python3 scripts/validate_project.py /absolute/project/path
```

The initializer must refuse a non-empty target. The validator must remain read-only. Do not replace these safety behaviors with ad hoc file operations.

## Fixed prompt output

Unless the user asks for a narrower artifact, return:

1. Mode and richness.
2. Intent and hard-constraint snapshot.
3. Model-independent master prompt.
4. Separate platform adapter; write `unspecified` when unknown.
5. Design summary for new prompts or modification summary for polishing.
6. Assumptions and unresolved choices.
7. Quality score with concrete deductions.
8. Risks and first-test recommendation.

## Preserve boundaries

- 默认不调用付费模型，不上传、不发布、不部署。
- Do not treat prompt writing as authorization to generate media.
- Do not invent an authorization, budget, provider, reference right, or delivery approval.
- Do not copy project-specific Hell Grind characters, assets, or long source prompts into a new project unless the user separately supplies rights and requests reuse.
- Keep each local initialize/validate operation at 0 network requests and 0 database operations.

If the user explicitly requests generation or publication, treat it as a separate action and follow the active tool's confirmation, cost, and safety rules.
